Network Intrusion Detection System using IBM Watson AutoAI and NSL-KDD dataset
# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using IBM Watson AutoAI

This project implements a machine learning-based **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using **IBM Watson AutoAI** and the **NSL-KDD dataset**. The system is capable of classifying network traffic as **normal** or various types of **cyber-attacks** (e.g., DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R). It includes an automated ML pipeline, a deployed model as a REST API, and a frontend for real-time predictions.
